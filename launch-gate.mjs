   0. HTML → VISIBLE TEXT. r8, AND IT IS A CORRECTNESS BUG, NOT A NICETY.

   Every gate in this portfolio strips tags with /<[^>]+>/g. That pattern
   stops at the FIRST ">", so an HTML comment containing one — and source
   comments are full of them — is only partly removed and its remainder is
   counted as visible page text. On opensentience.org a naive strip left a
   character from a hero comment that never renders, and two checks were
   reading it, one of them the retraction counter whose entire job is telling
   visible from hidden.

   So: comments come off first, as their own pass, then script and style, then
   tags. Everything downstream uses this one function, and §0.1 below proves
   it works on this artifact rather than trusting the comment you are reading.

   3. THE CONTENT SHIPS WITHOUT JAVASCRIPT — NARROWED 2026-08-17, DELIBERATELY

   This check used to read "the only scripts are the identity animation and
   the form upgrade" — in effect, no JavaScript at all beyond those two. That
   is the rule this surface dropped <amp-nav> to keep, and it dropped it with
   no ruling behind the decision.

   TRAVIS HAS NOW RULED: the ampersand-nav belongs on every website. The nav is
   a WEB COMPONENT; it cannot exist without a script. A check saying "no JS"
   would therefore have had to be DELETED to obey the ruling. So it is narrowed
   instead, to the property that was actually being protected:

       NO JAVASCRIPT THE CONTENT DEPENDS ON.

   The partition is explicit and the members are NAMED, never counted, so a
   third-party tag still cannot slip in on a loosened bound:
     · CHROME    — /amp-nav.js, the shared portfolio nav. Renders the nav bar
                   and nothing else on this page. §3b proves the page's text is
                   character-identical with it deleted.
     · THE OWN   — /phases.js, the identifying animation, which §12 proves
                   writes nothing into the document; and /say.js, which §5
                   proves is an upgrade to a form that already posts.

   silently is exactly how it vanished the first time.

   4b. r15 — THE BUILD PUBLISHES FILES THIS CHECK NEVER READ

   r14 was "the gate reads one file; the HOST serves a directory." This is the
   same defect one layer inward: the BUILD writes more than one file, and a
   blocklist that reads only index.html is not a blocklist. It was demonstrated
   on opensentience.org, where a retracted count was planted in a comment
   inside a published script and the gate reported green — three of that
   build's four emitted files were exempt from every text rule it had.

   This build emits three. So every retracted string is now tested against ALL
   of them, and the two that are not the page get a HARD ZERO: a script has no
   retraction block to hold a quotation, so any occurrence in one is a
   reinstatement with nowhere to hide. Same for a mailto: and an email address.

   The vendored ./amp-nav.js is deliberately NOT in this set — it is not
   written by this build, it is written by ampersand-nav/sync-nav.sh and only
   lane N may change it. It is covered separately, and honestly, in §5.

   14. THE CASCADE, RESOLVED OVER THE ARTIFACT. r7 and r8.

   A DECLARED TOKEN IS NOT A PAINTED COLOUR. `.top nav a` has specificity
   0,2,1 and `.btn` has 0,1,0, so an unqualified nav rule repaints a button
   inside the nav in --fg2 on --acc: the header call to action ships
   unreadable, and it did on all nine surfaces built before this one. Every
   contrast check above passed the whole time, because they read declared
   tokens and not the rule that actually wins on a real element.

   So this parses the emitted markup into elements with their ancestors, parses
   the emitted stylesheet into rules with specificity and source order,
   resolves `color` for every button the way a browser would — !important,
   then specificity, then source order, with media queries evaluated at a
   width — and refuses when a non-button rule decides a button's colour.
